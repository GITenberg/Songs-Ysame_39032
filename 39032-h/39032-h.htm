<i>WE cannot sing of life, whose years are brief,<br />
Nor sad heart-stories tell, who know no grief,<br />
Nor write of shipwrecks on the seas of Fate,<br />
Whose ship from out the harbor sailed but late.<br />
But we may sing of fair and sunny days,<br />
Of Love that walks in peace through quiet ways;<br />
And unto him who turns the page to see<br />
Our simple story, haply it may be<br />
As when in some mild day in early spring,<br />
One through the budding woods goes wandering;<br />
And finds, where late the snow has blown across,<br />
Beneath the leaves, a violet in the moss.</i><br />

<i>NOW I can sing of life, whose days are brief,<br />
For I have walked close hand in hand with grief.<br />
And I may tell of shipwrecked hopes, since mine<br />
Sank just outside the happy harbor line.<br />
But still my song is of those sunny days<br />
When Love was with me in those quiet ways.<br />
And unto him who turns the page to see<br />
That day's short story, haply it may be,<br />
The joy of those old memories he feels:<br />
As one who through the wintry twilight steals,<br />
And sees, across the chilly wastes of snow,<br />
The darkened sunset's rosy afterglow.</i><br />

WHENCE came the ember<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That touched our young souls' candles first with light;</span><br />
In shadowy years, too distant to remember,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where childhood merges backward into night?</span><br />
<br />
I know not, but the halo of those tapers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has ever since around all nature shone;</span><br />
And we have looked at life through golden vapors<br />

<h2>At Early Candle-Lighting.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THOSE, who have heard the whispered breath<br />
Of Nature's secret "Shibboleth,"<br />
And learned the pass-word to unroll<br />
The veil that hides her inmost soul,<br />
May follow; but this by-path leads<br />
Through mullein stalks and jimson-weeds.<br />
And he who scorning treads them down<br />
Would deem but poor and common-place<br />
Those whom he'll meet in homespun gown.<br />
But they who lovingly retrace<br />
Their steps to scenes I dream about,<br />
Will find the latch-string hanging out.<br />
With them I claim companionship,<br />
And for them burn my tallow-dip,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At early candle-lighting.</span><br />
<br />
To these low hills, around which cling<br />
My fondest thoughts, I would not bring<br />
An alien eye long used to sights<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Among the snow-crowned Alpine heights.<br />
An eagle does not bend its wing<br />
To low-built nests where robins sing.<br />
Between the fence's zigzag rails,<br />
The stranger sees the road that trails<br />
Its winding way into the dark,<br />
Fern-scented woods. He does not mark<br />
The old log cabin at the end<br />
As I, or hail it as a friend,<br />
Or catch, when daylight's last rays wane,<br />
The glimmer through its narrow pane<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of early candle-lighting.</span><br />
<br />
As anglers sit and half in dream<br />
Dip lazy lines into the stream,<br />
And watch the swimming life below,<br />
So I watch pictures come and go.<br />
And in the flame, Alladin-wise,<br />
See genii of the past arise.<br />
If it be so that common things<br />
Can fledge your fancy with fast wings;<br />
If you the language can translate<br />
Of lowly life, and make it great,<br />
And can the beauty understand<br />
That dignifies a toil-worn hand,<br />
Look in this halo, and see how<br />
The homely seems transfigured now<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">At early candle-lighting.</span><br />
<br />
A fire-place where the great logs roar<br />
And shine across the puncheon floor,<br />
And through the chinked walls, here and there,<br />
The snow steals, and the frosty air.<br />
Meager and bare the furnishings,<br />
But hospitality that kings<br />
Might well dispense, transmutes to gold,<br />
The welcome given young and old.<br />
Plain and uncouth in speech and dress,<br />
But richly clad in kindliness,<br />
The neighbors gather, one by one,<br />
At rustic rout when day is done.<br />
Vanish all else in this soft light,&mdash;<br />
The past is ours again tonight;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis early candle-lighting.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, well-remembered scenes like these:<br />
The candy-pullings, husking-bees&mdash;<br />
The evenings when the quilting frames<br />
Were laid aside for romping games;<br />
The singing school! The spelling match!<br />
My hand still lingers on the latch,<br />
I fain would wider swing the door<br />
And enter with the guests once more.<br />
Though into ashes long ago<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>That fire faded, still the glow<br />
That warmed the hearts around it met,<br />
Immortal, burns within me yet.<br />
Still to that cabin in the wood<br />
I turn for highest types of good<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At early candle-lighting.</span><br />
<br />
How fast the scenes come flocking to<br />
My mind, as white sheep jostle through<br />
The gap, when pasture bars are down,<br />
And pass into the twilight brown.<br />
Grandmother's face and snowy cap,<br />
The knitting work upon her lap,<br />
The creaking, high-backed rocking-chair;<br />
The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'spining'">spinning</ins>-wheel, the big loom where<br />
The shuttle carried song and thread;<br />
The valance on the high, white bed<br />
Whose folds the lavender still keep.<br />
Oh! nowhere else such dreamless sleep<br />
On tired eyes its deep spell lays,<br />
As that which came in those old days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At early candle-lighting.</span><br />
<br />
A kitchen lit by one dim light,<br />
And 'round the table in affright,<br />
A group of children telling tales.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Outside, the wind&mdash;a banshee&mdash;wails.<br />
Even the shadows, that they throw<br />
Upon the walls, to giants grow.<br />
The hailstones 'gainst the window panes<br />
Fall with the noise of clanking chains,<br />
Till, glancing back, they almost feel<br />
Black shapes from out the corners steal,<br />
And, climbing to the loft o'erhead,<br />
The witches follow them to bed.<br />
The low flame flickers. Snuff the wick!<br />
For ghosts and goblins crowd so thick<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At early candle-lighting.</span><br />
<br />
An orchard path that tramping feet<br />
For half a century have beat;<br />
Here to the fields at sun-up went<br />
The reapers. Here, on errands sent,<br />
Small bare-feet loitered, loath to go.<br />
Here apple-boughs dropped blooming snow,<br />
Through garden borders gaily set<br />
With touch-me-nots and bouncing Bet;<br />
Here passed at dusk the harvester<br />
With quickened step and pulse astir<br />
At sight of some one's fluttering gown,<br />
Who stood with sunbonnet pulled down<br />
And called the cows. Ah, in a glance<br />
One reads that simple, old romance<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">At early candle-lighting.</span><br />
<br />
One picture more. A winter day<br />
Just done, and supper cleared away.<br />
The romping children quiet grow,<br />
And in the reverent silence, slow<br />
The old man turns the sacred page,<br />
Guide of his life and staff of age.<br />
And then, the while my eyes grow dim,<br />
The mother's voice begins a hymn:<br />
"<i>Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer<br />
That calls me from a world of care!</i>"<br />
What wonder from those cabins rude<br />
Came lives of stalwart rectitude,<br />
When hearth-stones were the altars where<br />
Arose the vestal flame of prayer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At early candle-lighting.</span><br />
<br />
No crumbling castle walls are ours,<br />
No ruined battlements and towers.<br />
Our history, on callow wings,<br />
Soared not in time of feudal kings;<br />
No strolling minstrel's roundelay<br />
Tells of past glory in decay,<br />
But rugged life of pioneer<br />
Has passed away among us here;<br />
And as the ivy tendrils grow<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>About the ancient turrets, so<br />
The influence of its sturdy truth<br />
Shall live in never-ending youth,<br />
When simple customs of its day<br />
Have, long-forgotten, passed away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With early candle-lighting.</span><br />

<h2>Bob White.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
JUST now, beyond the turmoil and the din<br />
Of crowded streets that city walls shut in,<br />
I heard the whistle of a quail begin:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Bob White! Bob White!"</span><br />
So faintly and far away falling<br />
It seemed that a dream voice was calling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Bob White! Bob White!"</span><br />
How the old sights and sounds come thronging<br />
And thrill me with a sudden longing!<br />
<br />
Through quiet country lanes the sunset shines.<br />
Fence corners where the wild rose climbs and twines,<br />
And blooms in tangled black-berry vines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Bob White! Bob White!"</span><br />
I envy yon home-going swallow,<br />
Oh, but swiftly to rise and follow&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Follow its flight,</span><br />
Follow it back with happy flying,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Where green-clad hills are calmly lying.<br />
<br />
Wheat fields whose golden silences are stirred<br />
By whirring insect wings, and naught is heard<br />
But plaintive callings of that one sweet word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Bob White! Bob White!"</span><br />
And a smell of the clover growing<br />
In the meadow lands ripe for mowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">All red and white.</span><br />
Over the shady creek comes sailing,<br />
Past willows in the water trailing.<br />
<br />
Tired heart, 'tis but in dreams I turn my feet,<br />
Again to wander in the ripening wheat<br />
And hear the whistle of the quail repeat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Bob White! Bob White!"</span><br />
But oh! there is joy in the knowing<br />
That somewhere green pastures are growing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Though out of sight.</span><br />
And the light on those church spires dying,<br />
On the old home meadow is lying.<br />

<h2>Grandfather.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
HOW broad and deep was the fireplace old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the great hearth-stone how wide!</span><br />
There was always room for the old man's chair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the cosy chimney side,</span><br />
And all the children that cared to crowd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At his knee in the evening-tide.</span><br />
<br />
Room for all of the homeless ones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who had nowhere else to go;</span><br />
They might bask at ease in the grateful warmth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sun in the cheerful glow,</span><br />
For Grandfather's heart was as wide and warm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the old fireplace, I know.</span><br />
<br />
And he always found at his well-spread board<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just room for another chair;</span><br />
There was always rest for another head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the pillow of his care;</span><br />
There was always place for another name<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his trustful morning prayer.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, crowded world with your jostling throngs!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How narrow you grow, and small;</span><br />
How cold, like a shadow across the heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your selfishness seems to fall,</span><br />
When I think of that fireplace warm and wide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the welcome awaiting all.</span><br />

<h2>The Old Church.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
CLOSE to the road it stood among the trees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old, bare church, with windows small and high,</span><br />
And open doors that gave, on meeting day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A welcome to the careless passer by.</span><br />
<br />
Its straight, uncushioned seats, how hard they seemed!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What penance-doing form they always wore</span><br />
To little heads that could not reach the text,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And little feet that could not reach the floor.</span><br />
<br />
What wonder that we hailed with strong delight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The buzzing wasp, slow sailing down the aisle,</span><br />
Or, sunk in sin, beguiled the constant fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From weary heads, to make our neighbors smile.</span><br />
<br />
How softly from the churchyard came the breeze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That stirred the cedar boughs with scented wings,</span><br />
And gently fanned the sleeper's heated brow<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or fluttered Grandma Barlow's bonnet strings.</span><br />
<br />
With half-shut eyes, across the pulpit bent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The preacher droned in soothing tones about</span><br />
Some theme, that like the narrow windows high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Took in the sky, but left terrestrials out.</span><br />
<br />
Good, worthy man, his work on earth is done;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His place is lost, the old church passed away;</span><br />
And with them, when they went, there must have gone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sweet, bright calm, my childhood's Sabbath day.</span><br />

<h2>An Old-Time Pedagogue.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
SLOWLY adown the village street<br />
With groping cane and faltering feet,<br />
He goes each day through cold or heat&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Old Daddy Hight.</span><br />
His hair is scant upon his head,<br />
His eyes are dim, his nose is red,<br />
And yet, his mien is stern and dread&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Old Daddy Hight.</span><br />
<br />
The village lads his form descry<br />
While yet afar, and boldly cry&mdash;<br />
(For bears are scarce and rods are high)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Old Daddy Hight!"</span><br />
But when their fathers meet his glance,<br />
They nod and smile and look askance.<br />
He taught them once the Modoc dance&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Old Daddy Hight.</span><br />
<br />
How long we cling to servitude,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>How long we keep the schoolboy's mood!<br />
Still seems with awful power endued&mdash;<br />

Those fathers, yet, whene'er they see<br />
Adown the walk pace solemnly&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Old Daddy Hight.</span><br />
<br />
Wide is his fame, of how he taught,<br />
And how he flogged, and reckoned naught<br />
The toils and pains that knowledge bought&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Old Daddy Hight.</span><br />
He had no lack of "ways and means"<br />
To track the loiterers on the greens;<br />
He scorned all counterfeits and screens&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Old Daddy Hight.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, dire the day that brewed mishap!<br />
That brought to luckless back his strap,<br />
To hanging head his Dunce's cap&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Old Daddy Hight.</span><br />
No blotted page dared meet his eye;<br />
The owner quaked and wished to die,<br />
When rod in hand, with wrath strode by&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Old Daddy Hight.</span><br />
<br />
He helped them up the thorny steep<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Of wisdom's path with pain to creep,<br />
With vigilance that might not sleep&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Old Daddy Hight.</span><br />
Now, down his life's long, slow decline,<br />
He walks alone at eighty-nine&mdash;<br />

<h2>Her Title-Deeds.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
INSIDE the cottage door she sits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just where the sunlight, softest there,</span><br />
Slants down on snowy kerchief's bands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On folded hands and silvered hair.</span><br />
<br />
The garden pale her world shuts in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A simple world made sweet with thyme,</span><br />
Where life, soft lulled by droning bees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flows to the mill-stream's lapsing rhyme.</span><br />
<br />
Poor are her cottage walls, and bare;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too mean and small to harbor pride,</span><br />
Yet with a musing gaze she sees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her broad domains extending wide.</span><br />
<br />
Green slopes of hills, and waving fields,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With blooming hedges set between,</span><br />
Through shifting veils of tender mist,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smile, half revealed, a mingled scene.</span><br />
<br />
All hers, for lovingly she holds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A yellow packet in her hand,</span><br />
Whose ancient, faded script proclaims<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her title to this spreading land.</span><br />
<br />
Old letters! On the trembling page<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drop unawares, unheeded tears.</span><br />
These are her title-deeds, her lands<br />

OH, voices of the old, old days,<br />
Speak once again to me,<br />
I walk alone the old, old ways<br />
And miss your melody.<br />
To-night I close my tired eyes<br />
And hear the rain drip slow,<br />
And dream a hand is on my brow<br />
That pressed it long ago.<br />
<br />
My thoughts stray through the lonely night<br />
Until I seem to see<br />
Home faces, in the firelight,<br />
That always smiled on me.<br />
Those shadows dancing on the walls<br />
Are not by embers cast,<br />
They are the forms my heart recalls<br />
From out the happy past.<br />
<br />
Forgotten is the gathering gloom,<br />
The night's deep loneliness,<br />
As round me in the silent room<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>With noiseless tread they press.<br />

<h2>Silent Keys.</h2>

AS we would touch with soft caress the brow<br />
Of one who dreams, the spell of sleep to break,<br />
Across the yellowed keys I sweep my hand,<br />
The old, remembered music to awake;<br />
But something drops from out those melodies&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">There are some silent keys.</span><br />
<br />
So is it when I call to those I loved,<br />
Who blessed my life with tender care and fond:<br />
So is it with those early dreams and hopes,<br />
Some voices answer and some notes respond,<br />
But in the chords that I would strike, like these,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">There are some silent keys.</span><br />
<br />
Heart, dost thou hear not in those pauses fall<br />
A still, small voice that speaks to thee of peace?<br />
What though some hopes may fail, some dreams be lost,<br />
Though sometimes happy music break and cease.<br />
We might miss part of heaven's minstrelsies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But for these silent keys.</span><br />

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THE grandsire, in the chimney corner, takes<br />
The almanac from its accustomed place,<br />
And while the kettle swings upon the crane,<br />
And firelight flickers on his wrinkled face,<br />
Reviews the slow procession of the months;<br />
And sees again upon the hills of green<br />
The gypsy Springtime pitch her airy tent<br />
Among the blossoms. Then the silver sheen<br />
Of harvest moon shines down on rustling corn<br />
Until the hazy air of Autumn thrills<br />
With sound of woodman's ax and hunter's horn,<br />
And darker shadows climb the russet hills.<br />
<br />
But while he ponders on the open page,<br />
The last sand in the hour-glass slips away.<br />
The end seems near of his long pilgrimage,<br />
And he would call the fleeting year to stay.<br />
But passing on, she goes&mdash;a sweet-faced nun&mdash;<br />
To take within the Convent of the Past<br />
The veil of silence. Then the gates swing shut,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>And Time, the grim old warden, bolts them fast.<br />

<h2>Echoes From Erin.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
ACROSS old Purple Mountain I hear a bugle call,<br />
And down the rocks, like water, the echoes leap and fall.<br />
One note alone can startle the voices of the peaks,<br />
And waken songs of Erin, whene'er the bugle speaks.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They call and call and call,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Until the voices all</span><br />
Ring down the dusky hollows and in the distance fall.<br />
<br />
Methinks, like Purple Mountain, the past will sometimes rise,<br />
And memory's call awaken its echoing replies.<br />
Within the tower of Shandon again the bells will sway,<br />
And follow, with their ringing, the Lee upon its way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And chime and chime and chime,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where ivy tendrils climb,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Till bells and river mingle to sound the silvery rhyme.<br />
<br />
Again the daisied grasses beside the castle walls<br />
Will stir with softest sighing, to hear the wind's footfalls;<br />
And through the moss-grown abbey, along Killarney's shore,<br />
The melodies of Erin will echo evermore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And roll and roll and roll,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Till spirit hands shall toll</span><br />
The music of the uplands unto the listening soul.<br />

OH, happy valley at the mountain's feet,<br />
If half your happiness you could but know!<br />
Though over you a shadow always falls,<br />
And far above you rise those heights of snow,<br />
So far, your yearning love you may not speak<br />
With rosy flush like some high sister peak,<br />
Yet you may clasp its feet in fond embrace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And gaze up in its face.</span><br />
<br />
And sometimes down its slopes a wind will come<br />
And bring a sudden, noiseless sweep of snow,<br />
Like a soft greeting from those summits sent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To comfort you below.</span><br />
<br />
What more? Love may not ask too great a boon.<br />
Enough to be so near, though cast so low.<br />
Think that a sea had rolled between you twain<br />
If careless fortune had decreed it so,<br />
And you could only lie and look across<br />
To distant cloudy heights and know your loss,<br />
And see some favored valley, fair and sweet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Heap flowers at its feet.</span><br />

<h2>Through an Amber Pane.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
BY some strange alchemy that turns to gold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The light that drops from gray and leaden skies,</span><br />
Though heavy mists the outer world enfold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis always sunshine where Napoleon lies.</span><br />
No more an exile by an alien sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgetful of the banishment and bane;</span><br />
Now lies he there, in kingly dignity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His tomb a Mecca shrine beside the Seine.</span><br />
And there the pilgrim hears the story told,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How Paris placed above her hero, dead,</span><br />
A window that should turn to yellow gold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The light that on his resting place is shed.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So on him falls, though summers wane,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sunshine of that amber pane.</span><br />
<br />
By some strange miracle, maybe divine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sunlight falls upon the buried past</span><br />
And turns its water into sparkling wine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gilds the coin its coffers have amassed.</span><br />
Could it have been those long-lost halcyon days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Trailed not a cloud across our April sky?</span><br />
Faltered we not along those untried ways?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew we not weary as the days went by?</span><br />
Ah, yes! But unreturning feet forget<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rough places trodden in the long ago,</span><br />
Rememb'ring only paths with flowers beset,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While pressing onward, wearily and slow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For Memory's windows but retain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sunshine of an amber pane.</span><br />
<br />
The little white, wind-blown anemone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By one round dewdrop may be fully filled,</span><br />
And by some light-winged, passing honey-bee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its cup of crystal water may be spilled.</span><br />
So does the child heart hold its happiness:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A drop will fill it to its rosy rim.</span><br />
It is not that these later days bring less,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That joy so rarely rises to the brim;</span><br />
It is because the heart has deeper grown.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fuller knowledge must its thirst assuage.</span><br />
Perhaps we would not deem those pleasures flown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As bright as those which star the present age,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Had not upon them long years lain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sunshine of an amber pane.</span><br />
<br />
The dust of dim forgetfulness piles fast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the chains that thralled us yesterday.</span><br />
So will it be when this day, too, is past,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in its arms we've seen it bear away</span><br />
The cares that brooded in the tired brain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The work that weighted down the weary hand;</span><br />
The high hopes that we struggled to attain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The problems that we could not understand.</span><br />
Washed of its stain, bereft of any sting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seen through the window of the Memory,</span><br />
Perchance, a gentler grace to it may cling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than we may now think possible to see.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For skies will gleam, though gray with rain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like sunshine through that amber pane.</span><br />
<br />
We may not stand on Patmos, and look through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The star-hinged portals where the great pearls gleam.</span><br />
No brush that unveiled beauty ever drew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save one, that caught its shadow in a dream.</span><br />
So lest we falter, faithless and afraid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Merciful, remembering we are dust,</span><br />
Reveals not heaven for which our hearts have prayed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But by a token teaches us to trust;</span><br />
And day by day allows us to look through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The window of the Memory, broad and vast,</span><br />
(Till jasper minarets rise into view)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the happy heaven of the past;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And gives, till purer light we gain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sunshine of that amber pane.</span><br />

<h2>At a Tenement Window.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
SOMETIMES my needle stops with half-drawn thread<br />
(Not often though, each moment's waste means bread,<br />
And missing stitches leave the little mouths unfed).<br />
I look down on the dingy court below:<br />
A tuft of grass is all it has to show,&mdash;<br />
A broken pump, where thirsty children go.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above, there shines a bit of sky, so small</span><br />
That it might be a passing blue-bird's wing.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One tree leans up against the high brick wall,</span><br />
And there the sparrows twitter of the spring,<br />
Until they waken in my heart a cry<br />
Of hunger, that no bread can satisfy.<br />
<br />
Always before, when Maytime took her way<br />
Across the fields, I followed close. To-day<br />
I can but dream of all her bright array.<br />
My work drops down. Across the sill I lean,<br />
And long with bitter longing, for unseen<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Rain-freshened paths, where budding woods grow green.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The water trickles from the pump below</span><br />
Upon the stones. With eyes half shut, I hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It falling in a pool where rushes grow,</span><br />
And feel a cooling presence drawing near.<br />
And now the sparrows chirp again. No, hark!&mdash;<br />
A singing as of some far meadow lark.<br />
<br />
It is the same old miracle applied<br />
Unto myself, that on the mountain-side<br />
The few small loaves and fishes multiplied.<br />
Behold, how strange and sweet the mystery!<br />
The birds, the broken pump, the gnarled tree,<br />
Have brought the fullness of the spring to me.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For in the leaves that rustle by the wall</span><br />
All forests find a tongue. And so that grass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can, with its struggling tuft of green, recall</span><br />
Wide, bloom-filled meadows where the cattle pass.<br />
How it can be, but dimly I divine.<br />
These crumbs, God given, make the whole loaf mine.<br />

<h2>In the Dark.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
HERE in the dark I lie, and watch the stars<br />
That through the soft gloom shine like tear-bright eyes<br />
Behind a mourner's veil. The darkness seems<br />
Almost a vapor, palpable and dense,<br />
In which my room's familiar outlines melt,<br />
And all seems one black pall that folds me round.<br />
Only a mirror glimmers through the dusk,<br />
And on the wall a dim, uncertain square<br />
Shows where a portrait hangs. Ah, even so<br />
Beloved faces fade into the past<br />
And naught remains except a space of light<br />
To show us where they were.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">How still it seems!</span><br />
The busy clock, whose tell-tale talk was drowned<br />
By Day's uproarious voices, calls aloud,<br />
Undaunted by the dark, the flight of time,<br />
And through the halls its tones ring drearily.<br />
The breeze on tiptoe seems to tread, as though<br />
It were afraid to rouse the drowsy leaves.<br />
The long, dim street is quiet. Nothing breaks<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>The dream of Night, asleep on Nature's breast.<br />
Hark! Some one passes. On the pavement stones<br />
Each stealthy step gives back a muffled sound,<br />
Till the last foot-fall seems in distance drowned.<br />
So Death might pass, bent on his mission dread,<br />
Adown the silent street, and none might know<br />
What hour he passed or what he bore away.<br />
Ah, sadder thought! So Life goes, unawares,<br />
Noiseless and swift and resolutely on,<br />
While the dumb world lies folded in the gloom,<br />
Unconscious and uncaring in its sleep.<br />
And towards the west, the stars, all silently<br />
Like golden sands in God's great hour-glass, glide<br />
And fall into the nether crystal globe.<br />

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
MORE than the compass to the mariner,<br />
Wast thou, Felipa, to his dauntless soul.<br />
Through adverse winds that threatened wreck, and nights<br />
Of rayless gloom, thou pointed ever to<br />
The North Star of his great ambition. He<br />
Who once has lost an Eden, or has gained<br />
A paradise by Eve's sweet influence,<br />
Alone can know how strong a spell lies in<br />
The witchery of a woman's beckoning hand.<br />
And thou didst draw him, tide-like, higher still,<br />
Felipa, whispering the lessons learned<br />
From thy courageous father, till the flood<br />
Of his ambition burst all barriers<br />
And swept him onward to his longed-for goal.<br />
<br />
Before the jewels of a Spanish queen<br />
Built fleets to waft him on his untried way,<br />
Thou gavest thy wealth of wifely sympathy<br />
To build the lofty purpose of his soul.<br />
And now the centuries have cycled by,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Till thou art all-forgotten by the throng<br />
That lauds the great Pathfinder of the deep.<br />
It matters not in that infinitude<br />
Of space, where thou dost guide thy spirit-bark<br />
To undiscovered lands, supremely fair.<br />
If to this little planet thou couldst turn<br />
And voyage, wraithlike, to its cloud-hung rim,<br />
Thou wouldst not care for praise. And if, perchance,<br />
Some hand held out to thee a laurel bough,<br />
Thou wouldst not claim one leaf, but fondly turn<br />
To lay thy tribute, also, at his feet.<br />

<h2>Interlude.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
WITHIN the pauses of the anthem falls a hush,<br />
And the deep organ's solemn voice goes on alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In a low undertone,</span><br />
As rain comes sometimes with a sudden sweeping rush,<br />
And then is still, save that it slowly drips and falls<br />
From leaves at intervals.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So memory sings alone</span><br />
Between the busy hours when comes a lull,<br />
And naught is audible<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But its low undertone.</span><br />
So darkness drops between the days, an interlude<br />
When night's low sighing stirs the sleepy solitude.<br />
So, when the little cycle of this life is rounded,<br />
Before the spirit enters into life unbounded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">It waits to hear, with bated breath,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The solemn interlude of death.</span><br />

OH, dreary day, that had so late a dawn!<br />
Oh, dreary day, so long, though early gone!<br />
Fold thy gray mantle round thy form and go<br />
To find the lost sun, while Night comes on,<br />
Across the plain, with silent step and slow.<br />
<br />
I weary of thy dark, unsmiling mood,<br />
I weary of thy dull disquietude,<br />
And thy complaining voice that tells of pain,<br />
Not with the tempest's trumpet, but subdued<br />
In broken sentences of falling rain.<br />
<br />
Now, soft as household spirit, comes the Night<br />
And draws the curtains, fanning still more bright<br />
The cheerful fire, while for her gentle sake<br />
The tapers burst in bloom with yellow light,<br />
Like evening primroses just kissed awake.<br />

THE Spring steals through the city streets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Silent and shrinking, half afraid,</span><br />
As if there came, from woods and fields,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some timid, bashful, country maid.</span><br />
<br />
The lofty houses coldly frown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And coldly stares the stony street;</span><br />
But here and there from out a cleft<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There springs a flower to kiss her feet.</span><br />
<br />
And here and there a crocus smiles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A friendly greeting, or a spray</span><br />
Of blooming lilacs, fresh and sweet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leans down and nods across her way.</span><br />
<br />
Till, reassured, she smiles and sings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on she passes, glad and fleet,</span><br />
And little children at their play<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look up to catch her glances sweet.</span><br />
<br />
Is it her robe's soft fluttering<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That gently fans the passer by?</span><br />
He only feels the freshened air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor knows the gracious presence nigh.</span><br />
<br />
But some sweet influence he feels,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That charms care's gloomy shade away,</span><br />
And pours into his wakened heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The golden gladness of the May.</span><br />
<br />
So, like an angel visitant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She glides among the haunts of men,</span><br />
And faint hearts bound, and sad eyes smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because the Spring has come again.</span><br />

WHEN I go through the meadows brown,<br />

Think you I find no beauty there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since Summer through the fields has fled?</span><br />

The edges of the frozen stream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose quiet waters late were crossed</span><br />
By shadows of the bending fern,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are fair with fringes of the frost.</span><br />
<br />
Wherever cowslips crowded thick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or banks of buttercups would be,</span><br />
A host of airy forms in white,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like ghosts of flowers returned, I see.</span><br />
<br />
It may be clustered flakes of snow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or frozen dew still glistening there,</span><br />
But still it seems as if there came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A rare, strange odor through the air.</span><br />

<h2>October.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
ACROSS the stubble fields the lazy breezes pass,<br />
From Autumn orchards sloping southward in the sun,<br />
Where dropping from the low-hung branches, one by one,<br />
The apples hide in tangles of the wind-blown grass.<br />
A warm, sweet scent of mellow fruit fills all the air,<br />
And faintly over hills and hollows comes the cry<br />
Of some shrill bluejay, and his mate's far-off reply.<br />
Like Ruth, the winds will go a-gleaning, by and by,<br />
And garner in the leaves till all the woods are bare.<br />
<br />
But now my boyhood's love has come again to me,<br />
October&mdash;in her royal red and gold arrayed!<br />
She comes with glowing cheeks, my dusky Indian maid,<br />
And all the world seems bright because so bright is she.<br />
Unto her lips the wild grapes hold their spicy wine.<br />
Persimmons, sweet and golden with an early frost,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Drop at her feet; and where the narrow creek has crossed<br />
The woods, and in the ferns and flag its way has lost,<br />
Blood-red the corals of the dog-wood berries shine.<br />
<br />
And thus she comes, my Love I loved when I was young!<br />
We wander for a little while across the hills,<br />
And, as of old, her sunny presence warms and fills<br />
My heart. But like a lute with one string left unstrung,<br />
When I would sing again the song of other years,<br />
Something is lost. The harmony is incomplete.<br />
And though the same old melody I still repeat,<br />
One alto note of joy is gone that made it sweet,<br />
And something trembles in the Autumn haze like tears.<br />

<h2>The Prophet.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
DARKNESS and silence, such as only fall<br />
At midnight, wrap the sleeping hamlets all;<br />
No life in all the dim world seems to be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Then suddenly,</span><br />
Across the hills, far off and faint, I hear<br />
Sound through the dark, as through a dream, the call<br />
(How strange it seems!) of some bold chanticleer.<br />
<br />
(Half in my sleep I hear that clarion ring,<br />
With distant calls, like echoes, answering;<br />
And, as at war's alarum, soldiers leap<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">From guarded sleep</span><br />
And seize their arms, and hasten from their tents,<br />
So, at this sound, my drowsy senses spring,<br />
Alert to man the mind's dark battlements.)<br />
<br />
To tell night's mid-hour tolls no startled bell;<br />
Only thy voice is heard, brave sentinel,<br />
Who, like the ancient watchman on the towers,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">Calls forth the hours,</span><br />
And to the wistful questioners, who see<br />
No gleam through pain's long vigil, dost foretell<br />
"The morning cometh," oft and cheerily.<br />
<br />
How canst thou know when, weary with his race,<br />
The Day turns back, his pathway to retrace?<br />
Canst thou the maiden Dawn's light footsteps hear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Approaching near?</span><br />
Or dost thou stand in converse with the skies,<br />
And know what time she leaves her hiding-place<br />
By joyful flashes of their starry eyes?<br />
<br />
Thou art a prophet, like to those of old,<br />
Who in the darkness sat, but firm and bold<br />
Looked with undaunted eyes towards the dim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Horizon's rim,</span><br />
And thrilled with faith of waiting ages born,<br />
That soon from out the Night's strong prisonhold,<br />
Should burst the golden glory of the Morn.<br />

JUST outside of the noisy town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Half through thicket and wood revealed,</span><br />
Hemmed about by a wall of stone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wide it lieth, the Potter's Field.</span><br />
<br />
Brambles wander across the grass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vines creep over the broken wall,</span><br />
Bindweeds blossom, and here and there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stands a waif of the forest tall.</span><br />
<br />
There no columns of gleaming white<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mark the dust that is sacred still;</span><br />
Swings the gate on its rusty hinge&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All may enter and roam at will.</span><br />
<br />
Who should hinder the ruthless hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who protect from a vagrant's tread?</span><br />
Guard the urns of the rich and great&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No one cares for the pauper dead!</span><br />

<br />
Who could know of the shame and sin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Safely under the sod concealed?</span><br />
Weary burdens of want and grief,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laid away in the Potter's Field.</span><br />
<br />
Who could guess?&mdash;for as swift and light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er it the feet of the seasons go;</span><br />
Summer hides it with grace of flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Winter spreads it with folds of snow.</span><br />
<br />
Rains weep over the lonely mound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sunlight lingers, and swift shades pass;</span><br />
Tender hands of the gentle wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smooth the knots of the tangled grass.</span><br />
<br />
What though hallowed by Death alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rest unbroken the sod doth yield;</span><br />
Peace is here, for His constant watch<br />

<h2>The Legend of the Pansies.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
ONE night in Fairyland, when all the court<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Held carnival to welcome in the June,</span><br />
And to the wind-harp's music, flying feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were dancing on the rose leaves night had strewn;</span><br />
The naughty Puck crept up the castle stair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And called the sleeping princes from their bed;</span><br />
And with their royal pages following,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away the tricksy little fairies sped.</span><br />
Mounted on snowy night-moths, off they raced,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Startling the gnomes, asleep within the shade</span><br />
Of gloomy forests, with their merry cries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As at forbidden games all night they played.</span><br />
But when at sunrise blew an elfin horn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mischievous Puck was nowhere to be seen,</span><br />
The disobedient princes stood forlorn;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like dew-drops fell their tears on grasses green.</span><br />
For fairy children, not within the bounds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Queen Titania's realm at morning's dawn,</span><br />
Change into blooming flowers where they stand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bloom there till the summer time is gone.</span><br />
<br />
Now, where the little princes played all night<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In robes of royal purple and of gold,</span><br />
The flowers we call pansies sprang in sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And round them stood the little pages bold,</span><br />
In liveries of yellow, blue, and white;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While upward through the east the great sun rolled.</span><br />
Then some, repentant, sadly drooped their heads;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some turned their saucy faces to the sky;</span><br />
But now they all alike must wait the day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they can bid the summer time good-by.</span><br />
Sometimes, when bees upon their busy rounds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stop to deliver some sweet message sent</span><br />
From Fairyland, the thoughtful faces smile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seem to grow a little more content.</span><br />
When cooling shadows creep along the grass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mother birds are twittering lullabies</span><br />
To sleepy nestlings, then the south winds pass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And close with fingers soft the pansies' eyes.</span><br />
Upon the wings of dreams they're borne along<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To loving arms that rock them all the night,</span><br />
And fairy voices soothe their sleep with song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till they are waked by kisses of the light.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Men called and shouted each to each</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With strange, uncomprehended speech,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And what it meant no one could tell;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So they left building in despair.</span><br />
<br />
Yet in their hearts still lived the hope that they<br />
Might scale the ramparts of the sky some day.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sometimes our souls expand and glow</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">With holy visions bright and pure;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But when from these deep vales below</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We proudly try to climb and reach</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With clumsy masonry of speech,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And rounds of rhyme that shall endure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That sky-born thing, that heavenly theme,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Touched only by a prayer or dream,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A swift confusion o'er us flies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sudden chills our hands benumb.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our minds are blurred, our tongues are dumb,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The vision fades away and dies.</span><br />
<br />
Yet still we dream that song some day may be<br />
Rung through the arches of Eternity.<br />

<h2>The Old Bell.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THE vines have grown so thick and twined so strong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With clinging hold, about the bell that swings</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the old tower, that now it never rings.</span><br />
No one has heard its voice for seasons long.<br />
<br />
Sit by me on the broken belfry stair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I will tell the simple tale to you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of those whose graves through yonder arch you view,</span><br />
Scattered about the churchyard, here and there.<br />
<br />
Ah me! How closely memory's tendrils twine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About the heart, and choke the words that spring.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It only throbs, the touch half-answering,</span><br />
Like this old bell, held speechless by the vine.<br />

<br />
Like a discarded lover who entreats<br />

Up to the beach, with soft, caressing touch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tearful broken whispers, steals the tide.</span><br />
<br />
But still repulsed, it slow and sad withdraws,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet at the dear one's feet its treasures lays,</span><br />
And turns again, to wail its sorrows out<br />

IN that shadow-land, where the Sisters three<br />

There floated once through the fateful gloom<br />
A thread of sunshine, that gleamed upon<br />
The thread of a life from the distaff drawn,<br />
And mingling, they passed to the busy loom.<br />
The wondering Parcea looked and smiled,<br />
As the light grew into the soul of a child,<br />
And in and out and through devious ways,<br />
They wove it in with the woof of days.<br />
But they said on earth (who knew not the Fates)<br />
"As the lily's chalice holds the dew,<br />
So in her heart, at the morning's gates,<br />
She caught the sunshine, when she came through."<br />

But when his song comes borne across<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On winds from dreamland blowing,</span><br />
We cannot tell what mystic touch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has set his chimes a-going.</span><br />

We hear the robins in his rhyme,<br />

With crests of bloom that glimmer white<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When mists of tears are lifted.</span><br />

A hundred tunes seem intertwined<br />

When but a single rose, perhaps,<br />

UNTO him alone who strays<br />
Sometimes through the yesterdays,<br />

Of these songs. Adown the rhymes<br />
Runs a path to bygone times;<br />
But 'tis found by those alone,<br />

Of the country solitude;<br />
Who through lanes of pink peach blooms<br />
Used to see the lilac's plumes<br />
Nodding welcome by the door<br />
Where the home-folks come no more.<br />
Blest the singer, then, who leads<br />
Back again through clover meads,<br />

<h2>Chiaro-Oscuro.</h2>

SOMEHOW I love to look at the picture I made of her,<br />
Work of an idle time, the summer of life's long year;<br />
For as I stand and gaze, dreaming of those lost days,<br />
Almost it seems to me I can see her sitting here.<br />
<br />
That is the way she sat, with her head a trifle raised,<br />
Looking thoughtfully out at a scene I could never see.<br />
Delicate color of rose dawning and dying down,<br />
Flushing the rare sweet face as she listened or spoke to me.<br />
<br />
Whitest light of the sky I showered on her upturned brow,<br />
Gathered the darkest shades and brushed them into her hair,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Thinking the while I worked of the law that always sends<br />
The deepest shadows to follow the high lights everywhere.<br />
Now as I sit and gaze at the dream on the canvas caught,<br />
Sadly the thought comes back, to torture with unbelief&mdash;<br />
Why must it always be that the strong white light of love<br />
Is followed forevermore by the deepest shadow of grief?<br />

"WHEN she comes home," I thought with throbbing heart,<br />

Again from out the door I leaned and looked,<br />
Where she should come along the leafy lane.<br />
And then she came.&mdash;I heard the measured sound<br />
Of slow, oncoming feet, whose heavy tread<br />
Seemed trampling out my life. I saw her face.<br />
Then through my brain a sudden numbness spread.<br />
The earth seemed spun away, the sun was gone,<br />
And time, and place, and thought. There was no thing<br />
In all the universe, save one who lay<br />
So still and cold and white, unanswering<br />
Save by a graven smile my broken moan.<br />
She had come home, yet there I knelt <i>alone</i>.<br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
